## WorkFlowy Images on Zoom (WIZ)
* Place image links in the WorkFlowy bullet note. 
* No markdown required, existing markdown links should work too. 
* Image displays ONLY when zooming on the bullet. (only one image at a time)
* Default Dropbox and imgur links get automatically converted, no need to edit.
* Most Links containing `.jpg|.jpeg|.png|.bmp|.gif|lh3.googleusercontent.com` should display.
* The image link (and all note text) is hidden by the image.
* Click the image to toggle the note text visibility.
